        <p>This information is used strictly for diagnosing and resolving technical problems.</p>

        <p>b) Google Analytics for Firebase</p>

        <p>Device type and operating system;</p>
        <p>General usage patterns (e.g., which screens are viewed);</p>

        <p>We do not share this information with any third-party entities except for those services mentioned above.</p>

        <h3>4. Your Control Over Data</h3>

        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the information collected through our third-party services. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
